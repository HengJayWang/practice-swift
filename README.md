Practice Swift
==============
Practice does make perfect: an alternative way to learn Swift.
P.S: Updating the projects to Swift 2.2. **Work in progress**



## WHY?
I am new to iOS development and I started learning Swift more than a year ago.

This is my list of iOS projects following tutorials, books and code examples that I have found around the web.

Hope this material will be useful to other people and will help you to get a better understanding about Swift.

## Note
I try to keep this list updated. Adding new projects every day. Still learning :) 

## Feedback?
