 * =================================
**/

/**
Integers are whole numbers with no fractional component. They can be signed or unsigned.
Swift provides both formats in 8, 16, 32 and 64 bit.

The name convention uses UInt8 for an 8-bit unsigned integer, Int32 for a signed 32-bit integer and so on.

/**
==== Integer Bounds ====
You can access the minimum and maximum values of each integer type with its min and max properties
**/
// Min value is equal to 0 and type UInt8
let minValue = UInt8.min

// Max value is equal to 255 and type UInt8
let maxValue = UInt8.max
